# Enhanced 3D U-Net Model on MONAI Framework

_Ao Liu - 2024_

This project improves the 3D U-Net model in the MONAI framework by adding **Residual Mechanisms** and the **CBAM + 3D Reverse Attention** model structure.

The dataset used is from the [Medical Segmentation Decathlon](http://medicaldecathlon.com/).

This work references the [3D Segmentation with BraTS Dataset](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials/blob/main/3d_segmentation/brats_segmentation_3d.ipynb) tutorial from MONAI.
